# Content Automater

## Overview
Content Automater is a tool designed to automate the generation of SEO content based on keyword data stored in a CSV file. This tool utilizes a CSV file where each subsheet represents a product name, and within each sheet, keywords are listed along with their difficulty and monthly search volume. By leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, Content Automater transforms this data into rich and relevant content.

## How it Works
1. **Input Data**: Content Automater takes as input a CSV file structured with product names as subsheets and keywords, along with their difficulty and monthly search volume, listed within each subsheet.
2. **Data Processing**: The tool processes the CSV data, extracting relevant information such as product names, keywords, difficulty, and search volume.
3. **GPT Prompt Generation**: Content Automater formulates prompts for the GPT model based on the extracted data. These prompts are designed to instruct the GPT model on how to generate content related to each keyword within the context of the corresponding product.
4. **Content Generation**: Using the formulated prompts, Content Automater invokes the GPT model to generate content for each keyword. The generated content is tailored to be SEO-friendly and relevant to the product it represents.
5. **Output Generation**: The generated content is stored or presented in a format suitable for further processing or publishing, such as text files, HTML documents, or directly integrated into content management systems.

## Features
- **Automated Content Generation**: Eliminates the manual process of crafting SEO content for each keyword by automating the generation process.
- **Scalability**: Can handle a large volume of keywords and products efficiently, enabling scalable content generation.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Allows customization of prompts to fine-tune the generated content according to specific requirements or preferences.
